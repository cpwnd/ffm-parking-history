Tracking parking data from https://offenedaten.frankfurt.de

No live data since December 2021, because since then then at least the parking resource of the open data portal of Frankfurt is offline.

This repo archives the latest version of https://offenedaten.frankfurt.de/dataset/912fe0ab-8976-4837-b591-57dbf163d6e5/resource/48378186-5732-41f3-9823-9d1938f2695e/download/parkdaten_dyn.xml every twenty minutes, if it has changed.
